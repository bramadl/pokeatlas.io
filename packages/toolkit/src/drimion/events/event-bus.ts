/**
 * @description
 * A simple, in-process event bus that ships with the library as a zero-config
 * default. Suitable for monolithic applications, unit tests, and any context
 * where events do not need to cross process or network boundaries.
 *
 * `EventBus` implements `IEventBus` so it can be swapped for any external
 * transport (Redis, NATS, BullMQ, etc.) without touching domain code.
 *
 * Subscribers are registered per `type` string and invoked in registration
 * order. Each subscriber runs independently — a failure in one does not
 * prevent the others from running.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const bus = new EventBus();
 *
 * // Register subscribers (application layer)
 * bus.subscribe('order:placed', async (event) => {
 *     await sendConfirmationEmail(event.payload.customerId);
 * });
 *
 * // Publish after repository.save() (application layer)
 * await repo.save(order);
 * await bus.publishAll(order.pullEvents());
 * ```
