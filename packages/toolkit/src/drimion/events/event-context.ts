/**
 * @description
 * Provides a platform-aware mechanism for resolving the appropriate built-in
 * event manager at runtime.
 *
 * `EventContext` detects whether the current environment is Node.js or a browser,
 * then initialises and returns the corresponding singleton `BaseEventManager`:
 * - Node.js / Bun / Deno → `ServerEventManager`
 * - Browser              → `BrowserEventManager`
 *
 * Detection uses `process.versions?.node` rather than just `process` to avoid
 * false positives in bundled browser environments (Webpack/Vite) where `process`
 * may be polyfilled.
 *
 * @remarks
 * `EventContext` is an **optional, convenience utility** for the built-in event
 * managers. Application code that uses `EventBus` or a custom `IEventBus`
 * implementation does not need this at all — it exists only to simplify access
 * to `BrowserEventManager` / `ServerEventManager` when you choose to use them.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Resolve the platform-appropriate manager once at startup
 * const manager = EventContext.resolve();
 * manager.subscribe('order:placed', handler);
 *
 * // After aggregate mutations and repository.save():
 * for (const event of order.pullEvents()) {
 *     manager.dispatchEvent(event.type, event);
 * }
 * ```
